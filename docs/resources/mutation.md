# graphql_mutation (Resource)

A GraphQL mutation resource that can create, read, update, and delete resources via GraphQL mutations.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `compute_mutation_keys` (Map of String) A map of keys to paths for extracting values from the API response. Use JSON path syntax (e.g., 'createTodo.id' or 'data.user.id'). These extracted values become available in computed_values and are used for subsequent operations.
- `create_mutation` (String) The GraphQL mutation to create the resource.
- `delete_mutation` (String) The GraphQL mutation to delete the resource.
- `mutation_variables` (Dynamic) Variables for the create and update operations. Can be any valid JSON value (object, array, string, number, boolean, null).
- `read_query` (String) The GraphQL query to read the resource.
- `update_mutation` (String) The GraphQL mutation to update the resource.

### Optional

- `compute_from_read` (Boolean) If true, the provider will automatically generate compute keys from the read query response, saving the need to define read_compute_keys.
- `create_only_fields` (List of String) A list of paths to fields in mutation_variables that should be ignored during update operations.
- `delete_mutation_variables` (Dynamic) Variables for the delete mutation. Can be any valid JSON value (object, array, string, number, boolean, null).
- `enable_remote_state_verification` (Boolean) A pre v2.4.0 backward-compatibility flag. Set to false to disable resource remote state verification during reads. Defaults to true.
- `force_replace` (Boolean) If true, all updates will first delete the resource and recreate it.
- `read_compute_keys` (Map of String) A map of keys to paths for extracting values from the read query response. If not provided, defaults to compute_mutation_keys.
- `read_query_variables` (Dynamic) Variables for the read query. Can be any valid JSON value (object, array, string, number, boolean, null).
- `wrap_update_in_patch` (Boolean) If true, update mutations will wrap changed fields in a 'patch' object under 'input'. Use this for APIs that require patch-style updates.

### Read-Only

- `computed_create_operation_variables` (String) Computed variables for create operations.
- `computed_delete_operation_variables` (Map of String) Computed variables for delete operations.
- `computed_read_operation_variables` (Map of String) Computed variables for read operations.
- `computed_update_operation_variables` (String) Computed variables for update operations. This shows the actual mutation payload that will be sent to the GraphQL API.
- `computed_values` (Map of String) A map of values computed from the API response, used to populate variables for subsequent operations.
- `current_remote_state` (String) The current remote state of the resource, used for drift detection. This field is automatically populated during read operations.
- `existing_hash` (String) Represents the state of existence of a mutation in order to support intelligent updates.
- `id` (String) The ID of the resource.
- `query_response` (String) The raw body of the HTTP response from the last read of the object.
