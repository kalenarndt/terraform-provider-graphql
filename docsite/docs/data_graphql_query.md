## Synopsis
This provider contains a single data source, `graphql_query`, that is used for querying, or creating resources using a GraphQL API. This data source is appropriate when you need to read/create any resources without managing its full lifecycle as you would with the `graphql_mutation` resource.  

## Usage Overview
```hcl
data "graphql_query" "basic_query" {
  query_variables = {}
  query     = file("./path/to/query/file")
}
```

## Inputs

### query_variables
  - **Required**: true
  - **Type**: map(string)
  - **Description**: A map of any variables that will be used in your query. Each variable's value is interpreted as JSON when possible.

> NOTE: If a query variable is a number that must be interpreted as a string, it should be wrapped in quotations. For example `"marVar" = "\"123\""`.

### query
  - **Required**: true
  - **Type**: string (multi-line)
  - **Desciption**: The graphql query. ( See basic example below for what that looks like.)

### paginated
  - **Required**: false
  - **Type**: bool
  - **Desciption**: Whether or not the query uses pagination (based on standard GraphQL pageInfo cursor based pagination)

## Outputs

### query_response
  - **Type**: string (json encoded http response)
  - **Desciption**: A computed json encoded http response object received from the query.
    - To use properties from this response, leverage Terraform's built in [jsondecode](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/jsondecode.html) function. Will contain `paginatedResponseData` in place of `data` for query_responses derived from paginated queries. 

## Basic Example

Just like graphql on its own, this data source takes in the query variables, and the query itself:
```hcl
data "graphql_query" "basic_query" {
  query_variables = {} # this query does not take any variables as input
  query     = <<EOF
query findTodos{
  todo {
    id
    text
    done
    user {
      name
    }
  }
}
EOF
}
```

The query itself can be referenced in-line, as shown above, or it can be referenced from a file using terraform's built in [file](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/file.html) function.

## Advanced Example

```hcl
data "graphql_query" "advanced_query" {

  query_variables = {
      "name"  = "Jimmy Dean"
      "email" = "jimmydean@jdthesausageman.com"
  }

  query  = file("${path.module}/queries/readQuery")
}
```

With the above data source, you would create a file in the module path at `./queries/readQuery`:
```javascript
query getUser($name: String!, $email: String!) {
  user(input: {name: $name, email: $email}) {
    id
    name
    email
    phone
  }
}
```

As you can see above, if a query requires a user object as a parameter, you can build the object inline on the query and fill in the properties using variables. 

> NOTE: This provider does not currently support usage of complex objects as variables. query_variables must be a map of string.

The `query_response` output would be a json encoded object with the following structure: 

```json
{
    "data": {
      "user": {
        "id": "XXXXXX",
        "name": "Jimmy Dean",
        "email": "jimmydean@jdthesausageman.com",
        "phone": "1234567890",
      }   
    }
}
```
