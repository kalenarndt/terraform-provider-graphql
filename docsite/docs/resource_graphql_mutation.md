## Synopsis

This provider contains a single resource, `graphql_mutation` that can be used to automate the lifecycle of a GraphQL API resource. The `graphql_mutation` resource provides everything you need to create, read, update, and delete an api resource using GraphQL. 

## Usage Overview
```hcl
resource "graphql_mutation" "basic_mutation" {
  # variables
  mutation_variables = {
    "name" = "Jimmy Dean"
    "email" = "thewurst@jimmydean.com"
    "phone" = "\"1234567890\""
  }
  read_query_variables = {
    "email" = "thewurst@jimmydean.com"
  }

  compute_from_create = false

  compute_mutation_keys = {
    "id" = "user.id"
  }

  create_mutation = file("./queries/createMutation")
  update_mutation = file("./queries/updateMutation")
  delete_mutation = file("./queries/deleteMutation")
  read_query      = file("./queries/readQuery")
}
```

## Inputs

### mutation_variables
  - **Required**: true
  - **Type**: map(string)
  - **Description**: A map of any variables that will be used in your create & update mutation. Each variable's value is interpreted as JSON when possible. In order for the provider to keep track of state with respect to inputs provided in `mutation_variables`, you should ensure that your `read_query` includes the property that holds the value for your mutation variable. The keys do not need to be the same, as the provider with automatically map the keys based on value. See `query_response_input_key_map` description for details on how this works. 
  >NOTE: If a mutation variable is a number that must be interpreted as a string, it should be wrapped in quotations. For example `"marVar" = "\"123\""`. Any variables that are not actually used in mutations will be ignored. 

### read_query_variables
  - **Required**: false
  - **Type**: map(string)
  - **Description**: A map of any variables that will be used in the read query for the resource's lifecycle. 

### delete_mutation_variables
  - **Required**: false
  - **Type**: map(string)
  - **Description**: A map of any variables that will be used in the delete mutation for the resource's lifecycle (This is automatically combined with any computed variables). Each variable's value is interpreted as JSON when possible.
  >NOTE: If a mutation variable is a number that must be interpreted as a string, it should be wrapped in quotations. For example `"marVar" = "\"123\""`. Any variables that are not actually used in mutations will be ignored. Also `delete_mutation_variables` are merged with any variables that are computed based on the compute_mutation_keys input. The result is the computed_delete_operation_variables output (similar to computed_update_operation_variables).

### create_mutation
  - **Required**: true
  - **Type**: string (multi-line)
  - **Description**: A GraphQL mutation that will be used to create the api resource.
   
### update_mutation
   - **Required**: true
  - **Type**: string (multi-line)
  - **Description**: A GraphQL mutation that will be used to update the api resource.
  
### delete_mutation
  - **Required**: true
  - **Type**: string (multi-line)
  - **Description**: A GraphQL mutation that will be used to delete the api resource.

### read_query
  - **Required**: true
  - **Type**: string (multi-line)
  - **Description**: A GraphQL query that will be used to query the api resource after it has been created.

### compute_mutation_keys
  - **Required**: true
  - **Type**: map(string)
  - **Description**: A map representing the hierarchy of your response object leading to the object properties that will be used during a terraform destroy & update operation.
  
  **See the "Handling Update & Destroy" section below** for an overview of the `compute_mutation_keys` input usage. 

### compute_from_create
  - **Required**: false
  - **Type**: bool
  - **Description**: A bool to determine if computed keys should be computed based off of the response from the create request, or the read request.
  
  **See the "Handling Update & Destroy" section below** for an overview of the `compute_mutation_keys` input usage. 

### force_replace
  - **Required**: false
  - **Type**: bool
  - **Description**: A bool to determine if the resource should always be replaced (deleted and recreated) during update lifecycle hooks.
## Outputs

### query_response
  - **Type**: string (json encoded http response)
  - **Desciption**: A computed json encoded http response object received from the query.
    - To use properties from this response, leverage Terraform's built in [jsondecode](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/jsondecode.html) function.
    - 
### query_response_input_key_map
  - **Type**: map(string)
  - **Desciption**: A computed map between the values represented by mutation_variable inputs and query response object keys. The purpose of this comnputed map is for the provider to keep track of drift between a resource's server-state and its state representation in terraform. Its value is calculated by creating a map of key-value pairs such that the key is the key for a particular input of the `mutation_variables`, and the value is the key that represents the corresponding value in the `query_response`. For example, consider we have a query response with the following structure: 
  ```javascript
  "data": {
    "id": "123456"
    "user": {
      "id": "654321"
    } 
  }
  ```

  Consider there is a mutation variable input of `userID = "654321"`. The computed `query_response_input_key_map` would be: 
  ```javascript
  {
    "userID": "data.user.id"
  }
  ```
  Internally, the provider uses this map to check the state of given input properties against their value returned from server state via `query_response` during a read lifecycle. 

### computed_update_operation_variables
  - **Type**: map(string)
  - **Desciption**: A computed map that combines any computed variables with the `mutation_variables` input based on what is provided in the `compute_mutation_keys` input. 
    - This is also useful for outputing properties of the response object and using it on other resources (if you want to avoid that whole json decode thing mentioned above).
  
### computed_delete_operation_variables
  - **Type**: map(string)
  - **Desciption**: A computed map that combines any computed variables with the `delete_mutation_variables` input based on what is provided in the `compute_mutation_keys` input. 
  
### computed_read_operation_variables
  - **Type**: map(string)
  - **Desciption**: A computed map that combines any computed variables with the `read_mutation_variables` input based on what is provided in the `compute_mutation_keys` input. 

## Handling Update & Destroy

>This provider makes it simple to update and destroy api resources using computed properties (such as IDs). Since most delete and update mutations require a computed identifier, this provider will keep track of the object's computed identifiers (or any other properties you ask it to keep track of) in state.

### Defining computed variables:

As mentioned above, you define variables that _you_ want terraform to keep track of using the `compute_mutation_keys` input. 

  **Example**: We have a read query that returns an object with this structure: 
  ```json
  { 
    data: { 
      todos: { 
        id
        text 
        } 
      } 
  }
  ```
  We can define our `compute_mutation_keys` as:
  ```hcl
  compute_mutation_keys = {
    "id" = "todo.id"
  }
  ```

  In this example, `todo.id` describes the property we want to collect from the response object. 
  >NOTE: Since it is idiomatic for GraphQL server responses to return objects with a "data" parent property, the "data" property is implicit. However, you can define the mutation key as "data.todo.id" if that makes you sleep better at night.

  To add to this, we can collect N... variables using `compute_mutation_keys`. 

  For example, we can collect both the "id" and the "text" property off of a `todo` response by defining `compute_mutation_keys` as:
  ```hcl
    compute_mutation_keys = {
      "id" = "todo.id"
      "my_todo_text" = "todo.text"
    }
  ```
  
### Using computed variables

The only thing that we have to do to make use of the properties collected from `compute_mutation_keys` is to use those variables in your update and/or delete mutations.

  **Example**: We define a delete mutation that looks like this: 
  ```
  mutation deleteTodo($id: String!) {
    deleteTodo(input: $id) {
      id
    }
  }
  ```

  Since we told `compute_mutation_keys` to collect the `id` property, and we defined it as `id` in the `compute_mutation_keys` map, the delete mutation will automatically utilize the value returned from `todo.id` (which is collected during the read_query execution after a create or update execution). You could similary pass in a variable called `my_todo_text` to the mutation.

  This resource outputs `computed_update_operation_variables` and `delete_mutation_variables`, so you can always verify that they are reading values that you expect.

  The principles outlined above apply the same way to the `update_mutation`. If you need to utilize computed values in your update mutation, define them in your `compute_mutation_keys` input.
